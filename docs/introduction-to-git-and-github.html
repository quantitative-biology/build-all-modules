<div id="what-are-git-and-github-and-how-might-they-be-useful" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What are Git and GitHub and how might they be useful?</h2>
<p>As a biology graduate student or a professional biologist in a university or
government setting, there are several reasons you might want to use Git and
GitHub. We’ll discuss these shortly, but first give two definitions:</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">GitHub</span> refers to the website <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a>
where millions of people and companies ‘build, ship, and maintain their
software’. This is organised by users having a unique username. For a particular
project, a user creates a <span style="color: red;">repository</span>, which is basically a collection of code
needed for that project. Repositories can be public (anyone can see them) or
private (only accessible to users specified by the original owner). Hosting code
in a public GitHub repository allows users to share their code with the world
and collaborate with anyone. The term <span style="color: red;">repository</span> is generally used
interchangeably to mean both the collection of code (which includes some files
that Git uses) and the
GitHub website that hosts the collection of code.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">Git</span> is software that keeps track of the latest versions of your
files on your local computer. Your files can include computer code, data, write-ups of your
work, etc. Git allows you to interact with GitHub to fetch code that others have
changed, and to push your own changes so that others can retrieve
them. Crucially, it allows you to merge each other’s changes and easily keep
track of who has done what. It is called a ‘version control system’, which means
that you can go back to all earlier versions (instances) of your repository –
this is occasionally very useful.</p>
<p>The three main ways that you may want to use Git and GitHub are (starting with
the simplest):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You want do download someone else’s code from their GitHub repository.</li>
<li>You want to share your own code on GitHub with others. This will automatically
include the version control aspect mentioned above.</li>
<li>You want to collaborate with colleagues on a project.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will work through these in order, giving more motivation for each as we go
along.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-just-want-do-download-someone-elses-code-from-their-github-repository" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> You just want do download someone else’s code from their GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Each GitHub repository can be viewed on GitHub. We will take a tour of a GitHub
repository in the following video (TODO: add link to video.), that shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the layout of the GitHub website of a repository</li>
<li>the most useful parts to know about</li>
<li>how to download the code if you just want to get it and don’t intend to
collaborate (click the green ‘Code’ button and ‘Download Zip’); useful to get
the code to a supervisor, say.</li>
<li>just download one file by clicking on Raw and then save-as.</li>
</ul>
<p>To access a private repository, and for the rest of this module, you will need to set
up a GitHub account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for GitHub at <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a></li>
<li>If possible, choose a user name that will make sense to colleagues,
e.g. <strong>andrew-edwards</strong> or <strong>cgrandin</strong>, not <strong>pink-unicorn</strong> (such a name may
make sense to your current colleagues, but you may want something more
professional so that future colleagues know who you are)</li>
<li>Desirable: attach a photo (headshot) to your profile. This makes it easy for collaborators to identify you.</li>
</ul>
<p>For accessing a private repository, your colleague has to invite you from their
GitHub repository page (they would do Settings-Manage access). You will get an
email invitation, and once accepted you will have access to the repository when
you are logged into GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation-for-learning-more" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Motivation for learning more</h2>
<p>The above example is pretty basic. Motivation to learn more comes
from various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists (including students) are working far more collaboratively than in the past</li>
<li>This involves both sharing code and writing up results</li>
<li>There is a push towards open science – including your code as part of a scientific paper</li>
<li>We have called this a <a href="https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/40750152.pdf" target="_blank">TTT approach</a>:
<ul>
<li>Transparent – a clear and open way to show data, code, and results, enabling reproducibility</li>
<li>Traceable – a clear link from database queries and code to final results (numbers, tables, and graphs in a document)</li>
<li>Transferable – it should be feasible for another person to reproduce work and build upon it with a minimal learning curve</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Using Git and GitHub in your workflow greatly enables this, both when working alone and in a team.
We use them extensively:</p>
<ul>
<li>to collaborate on writing code and producing documents (such as this entire
set of modules!).</li>
<li>to easily share code and R packages publically for scientific papers, and
update them as necessary.</li>
<li>when working alone to retain a methodical workflow.</li>
</ul>
<div id="example-application-pacific-hake-stock-assessment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Example application – Pacific Hake stock assessment</h3>
<p>Under a formal Agreement between the Canadian and US governments, a team of four
of us (two from each country) conduct an
annual stock assessment for Pacific Hake (<em>Merluccius productus</em>) off the west
coast of Canada and the US. The assessment is used to manage the stock, which is of important
ecological and economic value ($100 million export value in Canada).</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/hake-picture.png" title="Artist rendition of a Pacific Hake." alt="Artist rendition of a Pacific Hake." width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We fit complex population models to data to make projections about future
health of the stock under different levels of catch. There is an extremely short
turnaround (four to five weeks) between getting the final data, doing the analyses
(model runs can take many hours of computer time), resolving new problems, and submitting the
assessment document, which is typically &gt;200 pages and contains numerous figures
and tables <a href="https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/2021-03/hake-assessment-post-srg-final_20210303.pdf?null" target="_blank">(2021 assessment available
here)</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to 2016, the document was assembled in Word, requiring lots of editing
and amaglamating of files, often late at night. Now we share our code via
GitHub, automate a lot of the document production using knitr (similar to
Rmarkdown which is covered in Module 2).</p>
<p>So with four people constantly working on the same large document, we need to
ensure we are keeping up-to-date with each other, can all produce the latest
version, and have <span style="color: red;">identical</span> folder structures on each other’s
computers. The alternative of emailing files back and forth is:</p>
<ul>
<li>very inefficient,</li>
<li>prone to errors,</li>
<li>just painful.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="examples-of-what-we-can-avoid" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Examples of what we can avoid</h3>
<p>Here are some real-world examples from <em>not</em> using GitHub, showing what we
can <em>avoid</em> when using GitHub.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Using GitHub it is easy to see what text/code collaborators have changed, avoiding
things like the following example of Track Changes in Word, for which it hard to see where to get started:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/interim.png" title="Example of Track Changes smorgasbord in Word." alt="Example of Track Changes smorgasbord in Word." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Often we may want to keep old versions of files (and email them back and forth), but
without GitHub we can end up with a veritable gong show, with multiple saved
versions of the same file:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/EAversions.png" title="Example of having multiple saved versions of a file." alt="Example of having multiple saved versions of a file." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can avoid having to manually co-ordinate having only one person working on the latest
version of a document. So we don’t get things like this example, which tells me
I shouldn’t really do anything now and should wait until others are done merging edits:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/proposalEmail.png" title="Example of having to wait for colleagues to merge edits." alt="Example of having to wait for colleagues to merge edits." width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can avoid having multiple versions of a file that then have to be carefully merged:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/dogsBreakfast.png" title="Example of having to manually manage multiple version of the same document." alt="Example of having to manually manage multiple version of the same document." width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>While GoogleDocs, for example, is fine for collaborating on a short document, it
isn’t suitable for sharing code that needs to be run on your local computer (or
complex code containing files that refer to each other), or complex documents
that are somewhat automatically updated.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-of-advantages-that-arise-from-using-github" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Example of advantages that arise from using GitHub</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Say you’ve off on a two-week hike while your collaborators
have been diligently working away and they have edited 15 new files of code in
five folders, added four data sets, and created five new pages of text towards
a manuscript. With GitHub you can easily
catch up with them (get all their changes onto your computer) with a few
simple commands. You don’t even have to pester them to ask what they’ve done,
as you can check it yourself.</p>
<p>So rather than this conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You: “Hey, I’m back from my awesome trip and saw some bears. What have you
been doing with the project?”</p></li>
<li><p>Likely reply: “Glad you had fun. I’m busy on something else right now. Er,
where were we at when you left?”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can have this one:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You: “Hey, I’m back from my awesome trip and saw some bears. I went through your
commits on GitHub and everything looks great. Shall I get on with those
questions you asked in the GitHub Issues regarding methods?”</p></li>
<li><p>Likely reply: “Glad you had fun, looking forward to hearing about it. I’m busy
on something else right now so, yes, resolving those Issues will be great,
thanks.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And the project keeps moving in an efficient way. We’ll cover GitHub Issues later.</p></li>
<li><p>By having code shared publicly, it is easy to answer questions, such as
this one I once received:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/MEEcodeQuest.png" title="Question someone once had about some code." alt="Question someone once had about some code." width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Rather than go searching on my laptop for the code that I hadn’t looked at
for six months, I could immediately open the file (on GitHub) by clicking on the
link the questioner sent. I could answer very
quickly, with a simple link to the file I am referring to (there is no ambiguity):</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/MEEcodeAnswer.png" title="Reply showing link to code on GitHub." alt="Reply showing link to code on GitHub." width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can even work out who last edited a particular line of code/text (GitHub
amusingly calls it ‘Blame’). Just open a file on GitHub and click Blame:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/blame.png" title="Example of GitHub showing who wrote each last line of a file." alt="Example of GitHub showing who wrote each last line of a file." width="578" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Though you’ll often find that it was you all along:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/scooby-blame.png" title="Very amusing cartoon based on the storyline in every Scooby Doo episode. " alt="Very amusing cartoon based on the storyline in every Scooby Doo episode. " width="448" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can properly keep track of ‘Issues’ on GitHub (discussed later) to be
thought about or fixed, rather than having things in emails that get forgotten:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/hakeIssues21.png" title="Example of GitHub Issues." alt="Example of GitHub Issues." width="910" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Important:</strong> You still have all your work locally on your computer. So if
your internet access goes down or GitHub is unavailable (which of course will only happen
when you have a deadline) you can still carry on with your work.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="why-this-course" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Why this course?</h3>
<p>Delving into the Git and GitHub world online it can feel like you need a
computer science degree to get started. This may not be surprising as Git
was written by the guy who wrote the operating system Linux, to help people
collaborate on writing the operating system Linux. But it means that, for
example, the second paragraph of the Wikipedia Git page says:</p>
<p>“As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most
client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged
repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities,
independent of network access or a central server.”</p>
<p>Say what??? That is fairly incomprehensible to those without strong computer science
backgrounds. The aim of this module is to introduce biologists to the world of
Git and GitHub, while avoiding a lot of the technical details. However, once you
have mastered the basics then it should be easier to delve deeper.</p>
<p>Our target audience is:</p>
<ul>
<li>graduate level biology students</li>
<li>biology faculty</li>
<li>government scientists</li>
<li>scientists in non-governmental organisations</li>
<li>in fact anyone wanting to learn these tools</li>
</ul>
<p>This work is extended from lectures and exercises developed by Chris Grandin and
myself as part of a
<a href="https://github.com/pbs-assess/TTTworkshop" target="_blank">Fisheries and Oceans Canada workshop</a>. (Luckily Chris
<em>does</em> have a computer science degree, and so was able to get some of us going
with Git and GitHub several years ago). These tools are now widely used within
our organisation.</p>
</div>
<div id="does-it-matter-which-computer-language-my-code-is-in" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Does it matter which computer language my code is in?</h3>
<p>For sharing code, it doesn’t matter what language your code is in (R, Matlab, Python, C,
…), as we will just be sharing text files. There is a learning curve, but once
you get going you only really need a few main commands. Unfortunately the hardest bit is
actually getting everything set up….</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="getting-set-up-for-the-first-time" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Getting set up for the first time</h2>
<p>Before you start using Git you need to set up your computer to use it, and
install a few other programs that are useful.</p>
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">one-time setup</span>
and, although it can sometimes be tricky, once it is done you
will be able to easily create new projects or join others in collaboration.</p>
<p>We have tested the installations as much as feasible. If you have an issue then
search the internet, as it may be due to some configuration on your particular
computer, and also programs do get updated.</p>
<p>This module is for any operating system: Windows, MacOS, Linux or Unix.</p>
<div id="what-you-will-end-up-having-installed" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> What you will end up having installed</h3>
<p>These are programs/things you will install. Obviously skip any that you already have working.</p>
<ul>
<li>A GitHub account (see earlier for instructions)</li>
<li>A text editor that isn’t Notepad</li>
<li>Git on your computer</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diffmerge or something similar for comparing changes to files (not completely necessary)</li>
<li>Markdown Pad 2 or Chrome extension or something similar for viewing Markdown files (not completely necessary)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="text-editor" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Text Editor</h3>
<p>You must have a text editor that is aware of outside changes in a file. This is necessary because if you have a file open in the editor and you download an updated version of the file, you want the editor to ask you if you want to use the updated version.</p>
<p>We know that <strong>Emacs</strong>, <strong>Xemacs</strong> and maybe <strong>Vim</strong> are okay, as is <strong>RStudio</strong>
for using R (and other) files.</p>
<p><strong>Notepad</strong> is not okay. But you can download and install <strong>Notepad++</strong> which is fine:</p>

<div id="install-the-git-application-on-your-machine" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> Install the Git application on your machine</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a> for downloading instructions for Windows, MAC and Linux/Unix</p>
<p>It seems best to accept the default options, except NOT Notepad or Vim (unless
you use Vim) as the default editor.</p>
</div>
<div id="git-shell" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> Git shell</h3>
<p>For this course we will use a simple git shell to type commands (rather than a point-and-click Graphical User Interface). This is for several reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Commands are the same across operating systems.</li>
<li>It is easier to demonstrate (and remember) a few simple commands, rather than follow a cursor moving across a screen.</li>
<li>Learning the text commands will give you a good understanding of how Git and GitHub work.</li>
<li>It is easier to Google for help when you get stuck or want to learn about more advanced options.</li>
<li>Commands are quick, and you can usually the up arrow (or ctrl-up-arrow) to
retrieve recent commands, or auto-complete commands using <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>.</li>

<p>There are many Graphical User Interfaces that are available, as described at <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis</a>.</p>
<p>Many (but not all) biologists use R in RStudio for their analyses. There is Git
functionality built into RStudio that we discuss briefly at the very end of
this module.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://magit.vc/" target="_blank">magit</a> which works in the text editor Emacs (which for years I have used
for pretty much everything, such as editing files, running R, Matlab, etc.). But
I would not have been able to learn magit without first knowing the Git commands
from using the shell.</p>
<p>For now we will stick with the Git shell for the aforementioned reasons. It will
also give you a better understanding of Git and GitHub, and emphasise that you
can use Git for any files, not just R code.</p>

<div id="powershell-and-posh-git" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.6</span> Powershell and posh-git</h3>
<p>Download a Powershell (a shell window in which you can type commands, presumably
the ‘power’ part means it’s more powerful than a basic version), Git, and then
posh-git (which adds some extra features). Do this by following the instructions at
<a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git" class="uri">https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git</a> .
Note that that is a GitHub site – it is storing the code for `posh-git’ (so
anyone can see the code), but when you scroll down you see instructions (like in
the repository example in the first video).</p>
<p>Do the ‘Installation’ and ‘Using posh-git’ sections. If you don’t understand
some options (I don’t!) just pick the simplest, usually the first.</p>

<div id="save-our-template-.gitconfig-file" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.10</span> Save our template <em>.gitconfig</em> file</h3>
<ul>
<li>Git uses a configuration file (called <em>.gitconfig</em>) for your account info, name to use when
committing, aliases (shortcuts) for commands, and other things.</li>
<li>We are supplying a template <em>.gitconfig</em> file that you will then edit.</li>
<li>For Windows, you will save it as
<code>C:\Users\YOUR-COMPUTER-USER-NAME\.gitconfig</code>, where YOUR-COMPUTER-USER-NAME
is your username on your computer.</li>
<li>For MAC and Linux (we think), you will save it as <code>~/.gitconfig</code>.</li>
<li>If there is already such a file there maybe save a copy of it under a
different name so you don’t completely overwrite it in the next step.</li>
<li>The template file is on GitHub
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantitative-biology/module-1-git/main/misc/.gitconfig" target="_blank">here</a>. Do
<code>Save-As</code> (right click or from a menu) and save the file as the filename mentioned above.</li>
<li>Just a reminder for your understanding: that file on GitHub is
shown in the normal way on the Github repository for this module:
<a href="https://github.com/quantitative-biology/module-1-git/blob/main/misc/.gitconfig" class="uri">https://github.com/quantitative-biology/module-1-git/blob/main/misc/.gitconfig</a>
and the link we gave you is from clicking `Raw’, which just gives you the raw
code for the file – this works for any file on GitHub, as mentioned in the
opening video.</li>

<li>Change the [user] name and email settings to reflect your information.</li>
<li>Change the [difftool] and [diffmerge] directories so they point to the

<p>You need to know how to change directories in the Git shell. This is like
clicking on folders or going back in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder
(Mac). Bascially you use</p>
<p><code>cd &lt;dir.name&gt;</code></p>
<p>to change directory (move into that directory),</p>
<p><code>cd ..</code></p>
<p>to go back up again, and</p>
<p><code>dir</code></p>
<p>to list the contents. These are all shown here, for which I opened up my Git
shell (there’s probably a shortcut on your desktop) and did the above commands,
moving into the <code>test</code> directory, seeing what’s there, and then moving back up:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/shell-commands.png" title="Screenshot of basic shell commands." alt="Screenshot of basic shell commands." width="540" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<div id="something-to-view-markdown-files-optional" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.14</span> Something to view Markdown files (optional)</h3>
<p>Each project has an associated <em>README.md</em> file that appears on its GitHub
homepage. The extension <code>.md</code> stands for Markdown and is just an ASCii text file
that contains simple formatting (such as bold or italics). You can edit the file
in any text editor. There are two options we have used to view the rendered
versions of markdown files (rendered means it utilises the formatting you have
coded). Choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Markdown Pad 2 editor/viewer which is easy to use: <a href="http://markdownpad.com" class="uri">http://markdownpad.com</a>. Just get the free version.</li>
<li>The Chrome extension for markdown viewing: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=en" class="uri">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=en</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an intuitive short introduction to Markdown, which is worth looking at
once you start writing more in your <em>README.md</em> files:
<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" class="uri">https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet</a>.</p>
<p>With one of the above two options installed when you click on a <em>README.md</em> file
you can edit the file and also see the rendered (formatted) version. I find that
Markdown Pad 2 doesn’t show (render) the <em>README.md</em> file exactly the same way as it
appears on the GitHub website, with the GitHub version being better.</p>

<p>CHECK: This section also has two (TODO: may split first one up) recorded videos to
demonstrate the main concepts and ideas. We suggest watching a video and then
attempting the corresponding exercise. The notes here also give the details you
need, so you can easily refer to them after first watching the corresponding
video.</p>
<p>The first video is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wLNNNn1e2zTKTjh8QAfTcS7L22990RRO">here</a>
and the slides from the talk are <a href="TODO">to be added</a>TODO, though the notes below mostly
replicate the slides.</p>
<div id="definitions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Definitions</h3>
<p>Let’s recall the main definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repository – essentially a directory containing all your files for a
project (plus some files that Git uses). Also used to mean the website on GitHub.</li>
<li>Git – a program that allows you to efficiently save ongoing versions of
your files (`version control’) and link with GitHub.</li>
<li>GitHub – a website that hosts your repositories so that you can easily
share code and collaborate with colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the idea is that you work on your files in a repository on your computer, use Git on
your computer when you are happy to keep your changes, and use GitHub to easily
share the files.</p>
<p>In the opening video you learnt how to navigate a repository on GitHub and how
to download other people’s code Here you will learn the important steps for your
own repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating – create a new repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Cloning – copying it to your local computer</li>
<li>Committing – the crux of working with Git</li>
<li>Collaborating – efficiently work with colleagues</li>
<li>Conflicts – fixing conflicting changes when collaborating (happens rarely)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-new-repository" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> Creating a new repository</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sign into your GitHub account, click on the <em>Repositories</em> tab, and press the <em>New</em> button.</li>
<li>Give your repository a name. Let’s call it test.</li>
<li>Check <em>Initialize</em> this <em>repository</em> with a <em>README</em>.</li>
<li>Leave <em>Add .gitignore</em> and <em>Add a license</em> set to <em>None</em></li>
<li>Click <em>Create repository</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You now have a new repository on the GitHub website. Next we will clone it onto your computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="cloning-your-new-repository" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.3</span> Cloning your new repository</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy the full URL (web address) of your test repository.</li>
<li>Open the Git shell and navigate to your <code>C:/github</code> directory (or whatever you called it when you created it in the setup instructions – it’s the place you are going to save all your Git repositories).</li>
<li>Run the following command to <em>clone</em> your repository:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git clone URL</code></p>
<p>where URL is the url of your newly created repository (paste should work).</p>
<p>You should now have a subdirectory called <code>github/test</code> on your computer.
In Git shell, change to that directory (with <code>cd test</code>). The command <code>cd</code> just
stands for <code>change directory</code>, to go back to where you were just do <code>cd ..</code>. You
probably want to also open the directory using your usual graphical interface (e.g. File Explorer
in Windows) to check what is happening.</p>
<p>So ‘clone’ is Git speak for copying something from GitHub onto your local
computer. This example has just one file (<em>README.md</em>). But the process is the
same for a repository with multiple files and multiple directories, and the
complate file sturcture is fully preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Windows only: Storing your credentials</strong></p>
<p>When you are using the Git shell for the very first time on Windows, issue the following command:</p>
<p><code>git config --global credential.helper wincred</code></p>
<p>This means that you don’t have to repeatedly enter you GitHub password (just do it when you are first prompted).</p>
</div>
<div id="committing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.4</span> Committing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a new file, <em>newFile.txt</em>, in the <code>github/test</code> directory.</li>
<li>Open it, add a line of text at the start of the file and save it.</li>
<li>Check the status of your (test) repository:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git status</code></p>
<ul>
<li>It should say that you have an ‘Untracked file’ called <em>newFile.txt</em>. You want
to tell Git to start tracking it, by using:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git add. gitignore</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <code>git status</code> again.</li>
<li>You should see that the file is listed as a ‘new file’ under ‘Changes to be commited’.</li>
<li>Let’s now ‘commit’ it:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git commit -a -m &quot;Add newFile.txt.&quot;</code></p>
<p>The commit message (in the quotes) should be a useful message saying what the
commit encapsulates (more on that later).</p>
<ul>
<li>Push the commit to GitHub:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git push</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Check (refresh) the GitHub webpage and see your commit and the uploaded file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What just happened?</strong></p>
<p>We just used three of the main Git commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code> – tell Git to start keeping track of changes to this file. You only need to tell Git this once.</li>
<li><code>git commit -a -m &quot;Message.&quot;</code> – committing your changes, which means tell Git you are happy with your edits and want to save them.</li>
<li><code>git push</code> – this sends your commit to the GitHub website.</li>
</ul>
<p>You always have your files stored locally on your computer (as usual), even if you don’t add them or commit changes.</p>
<p>When you push to GitHub then your colleagues can easily fetch (retrieve) them.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard aliases (shortcuts)</strong></p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p><code>git commit -a -m &quot;Message.&quot;</code></p>
<p>is a bit much to type, so we have an alias for it:</p>
<p><code>git com &quot;Message.&quot;</code></p>
<p>This is defined in the <em>.gitconfig</em> file you installed in the <code>git-setup</code>
instructions into <code>C:\Users\YOUR-USER-NAME\.gitconfig</code> (for Windows). You can
also add your own commands to that file.</p>
<p>The <code>-a</code> means ‘commit all changes of files that Git is tracking’, and <code>-m</code> is
to include a message. Since we usually want to do both of these,
<code>git com &quot;Message.&quot;</code> is a useful shortcut. But it is important to realise it is an alias if searching online for help.</p>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<p><code>git s</code> – for <code>git status</code></p>
<p><code>git p</code> – for <code>git push</code></p>
<p><code>git d</code> – for <code>git diff</code></p>
<p><code>git f</code> – for <code>git fetch</code></p>
<p>From now on we will mostly use the aliases. Use the full commands if the
<em>.gitconfig</em> file didn’t work for you.</p>
<p><strong>Edit <em>Readme.md</em></strong></p>
<p>Edit the <em>Readme.md</em> file. Add some simple comments describing the project such as: “A test repository for learning Git.”</p>
<p>Look over the changes, commit them, and push them to your GitHub repository:</p>
<p><code>git s</code></p>
<p><code>git d</code> (or <code>git diff</code>) – this gives a simple look at the differences between
the last committed version and your current version (of all files; only one in
this case).</p>
<p><code>git com</code> “Initial edit of Readme.md”</p>
<p><code>git p</code> (or <code>git push</code>)</p>
<p>Refresh your GitHub web page and you should see your text (the <em>Readme.md</em> file is what is shown on the main page of your repo).</p>
<p>If you got Diffmerge installed okay, then instead of <code>git diff</code> you can do <code>git difftool</code>. This opens up, in turn, each file that changed since your last commit
and shows you the differences. On the right is the new text (actually the code
for this paragraph):</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/git-difftool.png" title="Screenshot of using git difftool." alt="Screenshot of using git difftool." width="751" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This is useful for changes that are more complex
than can be easily see in the quick <code>git d</code>.</p>

<div id="exercise-1-create-edit-and-commit-simpletext.txt" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.5</span> Exercise 1: create, edit and commit <em>simpleText.txt</em></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a text file <em>simpleText.txt</em> in your local <code>test</code> repository. Add a
line of text at the start and save it.</li>

<li>Add the file to the repository using the git commands:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>git add simpleText.txt</code></p>
<p><code>git s</code> – not necessary but useful to check you understand what is changing before you commit</p>
<p><code>git com &quot;Adding simpleText.txt&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>git p</code></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add some more test to <em>simpleText.txt</em> then <code>git com &quot;Message.&quot;</code> and <code>git p</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat this a few times to get the hang of it. <code>git com</code> frequently and <code>git p</code> occasionally (you do not have to push every commit), while intermittently doing <code>git s</code> and <code>git d</code> to understand what’s changing.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your commits by refreshing the GitHub page.</li>
</ol>
<p>In reality when writing code/text you won’t be committing quite so frequently,
as your focus will be on the writing the actual code/text.</p>
<p><strong>Adding multiple files at once</strong></p>
<p>Often you add multiple files in a new directory. When you run <code>git s</code>, you will
see a large list of <em>Untracked files</em>. They can be all added at once by simply
adding the whole directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise-2-multiple-files" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.6</span> Exercise 2: multiple files</h3>
<p>Do the following, to get the idea of creating multiple files in a folder and
committing that folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new directory called <em>new-stuff</em> in your <code>test</code> repository, using your normal method
(e.g. in File Explorer, or just <code>mkdir new-stuff</code> in the shell). Navigate to
it in your shell (<code>cd new-stuff</code>).</li>
<li>Add a few new test files to that directory called <em>test1.txt</em>, <em>test2.txt</em>,
etc. Put some example text in one or more of them if you want.</li>
<li>On the command line, check the status:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git s</code></p>
<ul>
<li>You will see a listing showing the <em>new-stuff/</em> directory in <em>Untracked files</em>.</li>
<li><p>To add all the new files in preparation for a commit, issue the command:
<code>git add new-stuff/</code></p></li>
<li>Check the status of the repository again with <code>git s</code></li>
<li>It will now show all files in <em>Changes to be committed</em></li>
<li><p>Commit the changes:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>git com &quot;Added new-stuff directory.&quot;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Push the changes to GitHub:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git p</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Check your GitHub webpage and see your commit and that the files have been uploaded.</li>
<li>That works no matter how many files are in your new-stuff directory. There
could be a hundred and it’s the same command.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wildcard symbol <code>*</code></strong></p>
<p>This is useful to know (no need to do it as part of the exercise):</p>
<ul>
<li>To add multiple files with similar names you can use the wildcard <code>*</code> symbol.</li>
<li>You just added (told Git to keep track of) the new files in your <em>new-stuff/</em> directory.</li>
<li>If you add more new files to that directory, you will have to tell Git to
track those also. This is because they are new – you haven’t told Git about them yet.</li>
<li>Say you have 10 new files called <em>idea1.txt</em>, <em>idea2.txt</em>, …, <em>idea 10.txt</em>.</li>
<li>Instead of typing</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/idea1.txt</code></p>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/idea2.txt</code></p>
<p>etc. you can just use the wildcard symbol <code>*</code> which stands for any piece of text:</p>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/idea*.txt</code></p>
<p>or even just</p>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/*.txt</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/*.*</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>.gitignore</em> file</strong></p>
<p>But what if you don’t want to add all the files that you create?</p>
<p>Each repository can have a <em>.gitignore</em> file, in the root directory of the repository.
Such a file has names of files (such as <em>my-secret-notes.txt</em>) or wildcard names
(such as <code>*.pdf</code> or <code>*.doc</code>) that will be completely ignored by Git.</p>
<p>For an example, see
<a href="https://github.com/pacific-hake/hake-assessment/blob/master/.gitignore" class="uri" target="_blank">https://github.com/pacific-hake/hake-assessment/blob/master/.gitignore</a>,
noting that the <code>#</code> can be used for comments.</p>
<p>When sharing a repository with others, you want to share your <em>code</em> (for
example, R, Python or Matlab code) and maybe data, but generally <em>not</em> share the
output (such as figures that the code generates; more on this later). For
reproducible research your colleague (or anyone) should be able to run your code
to generate the results.</p>
<p>Some programs you run may make temporary files that don’t need to be tracked by
Git, the names of which should also be included in your <em>.gitignore</em>.</p>
<p>When sharing code or collaborating you want to keep your repository as clean as
possible and not clutter it up with files that other people don’t need.</p>
<p>So when you run <code>git s</code> and see untracked files that you don’t want to be
tracked, add them (or a suitable wildcard expression) to your <em>.gitignore</em> file
so that they are not added inadvertently.</p>
<p>This will also simplify your workflow (you don’t need to keep being reminded
that you have untracked files).</p>
<p>If you are on MacOS and you find that folders have a <em>.DS_Store</em> file in them,
then include <em>.DS_Store</em> as a line in your <em>.gitignore</em> file.</p>
<p>Generally, when you create a new repository you probably want to copy an
existing <em>.gitignore</em> file over from an existing repository, as you will
generally want to ignore the same types of files.</p>
<p>You can also choose the <em>private repository</em> option when creating a repository,
so that you can control who can see it. On your repository page on GitHub, go to
<code>Settings--Manage Access</code> to add collaborators.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-to-write-in-commit-messages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.7</span> What to write in commit messages</h3>
<p>You don’t want to agonise over what you write in your commit messages, when
doing <code>git com &quot;Message&quot;</code>, but it is worthwhile making them useful. Ideally</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to describe <em>what</em> (and sometimes <em>why</em>) you did something.</li>
<li>The <em>how</em> is not needed since that will be explained by the actual
changes in the code. If someone wants to see how something was done, they
can see what was changed in detail in the commit.</li>
<li>The message should be informative for collaborators (including your future self).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: red;">Not useful:</span></p>
<p><code>git com &quot;Tweaked function.&quot;</code></p>
<p><span style="color: blue;">Useful:</span></p>
<p><code>git com &quot;Allow plot.biomass() to use extra colours.&quot;</code></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to just complete the sentence “<span style="color: red;">This commit will …</span>”.</p>
<p>This is helpful for your collaborators and your future self.</p>
<p>You have now learnt the basics of using Git. By creating a public repository on
GitHub you can now release your code to the world!</p>

usefulness of Git will become more apparent.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to collaborate using Git and GitHub. We will
focus on the following one since it is the simplest, and is what you need to
collaborate with colleagues.</p>
<p>Concept: there is a project where people contribute to a main repository that is
considered the ‘master copy’.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone clones directly from the creator’s repository.</li>
<li>All collaborators push their commits to the repository (the creator has
to add them as collaborators once on GitHub).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the creator has to grant permission, you won’t have just anyone
contributing to (and maybe messing up your work), just your trusted collaborators.</p>
<p>But you have to trust your team to not mess things up (more on that later!).</p>
<p>Now watch this
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqdFBnVg_zwP6SiW-KSTp6wZzAILDeeC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">video</a>
in which we demonstrate the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kim creates new repo called <code>collaborate</code> (and clones it to her computer).</li>
<li>Andy clones it also.</li>
<li>On GitHub, Kim gives Andy ‘push access’ to her <code>collaborate</code> repo.</li>
<li>Both do some edits (create some new simple text files).</li>
<li><p>For Andy to get Kim’s updates (and vice versa), he just uses:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git fetch</code> (or just <code>git f</code>) – fetches the latest version of the repository from GitHub onto your computer. Your local files have <em>not</em> yet changed (check them), but Git has the changes stored on your computer (?!?).</li>
<li><code>git rebase</code> – updates your local repository (the committed files on your computer) with the changes you have just fetched, merging both people’s work together.</li>
<li><code>git p</code> – pushes the merged changes back up to GitHub so that the other person can get them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>That is the basic workflow.</p>
<p>In the video you saw that we also showed an example of <code>git p</code> <em>not</em> being allowed for Person A because
there are recent commits on GitHub (by Person B) that Person A has not yet
merged into their local version of the repository.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the error message you get:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/unable-to-pull.png" title="Example of a lengthy error message when trying to push; essentially its just telling you to pull before trying to push." alt="Example of a lengthy error message when trying to push; essentially its just telling you to pull before trying to push." width="626" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>While a bit lengthy, the error message is useful. It forces you to get the other
person’s work before you push yours. You do this by:</p>
<p><code>git f</code>
<code>git rebase</code>.</p>
<p>So to be allowed to push, just <code>fetch</code> to get the new commits onto your computer,
and then <code>rebase</code> to combine the commits into your local version. Then you can</p>
<p><code>git push</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a full screenshot (‘g’ is just a shortcut for ‘git’). The green up arrow
number 8 tells me I have 8 commits to push to GitHub. The yellow arrows I think
of as just implying I need to do a rebase (before doing that I might browse
through the other person’s commits on GitHub):</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/fix-the-pull.png" title="Example of output when having 8 commits to push but then having to fetch and then rebase." alt="Example of output when having 8 commits to push but then having to fetch and then rebase." width="839" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>After the <code>rebase</code> I was allowed to <code>push</code> and then everything is up to date.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-bit-more-about-git-rebase" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.2</span> A bit more about git rebase</h3>
<ul>
<li>Andy commits local changes, tries to <code>git push</code> but is told to first <code>git fetch</code> (to get Kim’s changes from GitHub).</li>
<li>Andy does <code>git fetch</code> and then <code>git rebase</code>.</li>
<li>What <code>git rebase</code> does is basically rewind to the last common commit that both
people had, and then add one person’s commits and the others.</li>
<li>Andy then does <code>git push</code> to push his commits to GitHub (from where Kim will fetch them when she’s ready).</li>
<li>Providing there are no conflicts, this will work fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another option you hear about is to do a <code>git merge</code>, which basically creates a new commit that merges both people’s work together.
In our teams we used to use <code>git merge</code> and now use <code>git rebase</code>; some people don’t
like <code>git merge</code> because it adds extra commits.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth understanding <a href="https://reflectoring.io/git-rebase-merge/" target="_blank">see here</a> for one of the clearer explanations out there concerning rebase versus merge.</p>
<p>Note that the error in the above screenshot (when I could not <code>git push</code>) told
me that I might want to do <code>git pull</code>. This is basically</p>
<p><code>git fetch</code></p>
<p><code>git merge</code></p>
<p>in one command, but it seems preferable to do</p>
<p><code>git fetch</code></p>
<p><code>git rebase</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="fixing-a-conflict" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3</span> Fixing a conflict</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <span style="color: red;">conflict</span> happens when two people have edited the <span style="color: red;">same line(s) of the same
file</span>.</li>
<li>Conflicts happen relatively rarely and can be generally avoided by
co-ordinating with collaborators so that you are working on different
files. But, they will happen and you need to know how to resolve them.</li>
<li>Git <em>forces</em> you to explicitly decide whose changes to keep – this is a <span style="color: red;">good</span>
thing, since you want a human to make such a decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the video we demonstrated a conflict.</p>
<p>The best approach I have found to fixing a conflict is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying <code>git rebase</code> will tell you there is a conflict.</li>
<li><code>git rebase --abort</code> – do this to abort the rebase attempt.</li>
<li><code>git merge</code> – this will tell you there is a conflict.</li>
<li>Open the file(s) with the conflict and edit the text (see below).</li>
<li><code>git add &lt;filename(s)&gt;</code> – you have to then add the files that had the conflict (I am not sure why this is necessary, I just do it).</li>
<li><code>git com &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot;</code> – in your commit message you can explain how you fixed
the conflict. This is useful so that your collaborators know you have resolved
a conflict (they can look at the commit to see if they are happy with it).</li>
</ul>
<p>The merge message will tell you which files are conflicting. Open those files
one by one, and you will see the conflicted section bracketed like the
following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Line(s) of text/code which are currently in your file.
 =======
Line(s) of text/code which are trying to merge in, but conflict.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; origin/main</code></pre>
<p>where <code>origin/main</code> refers to the version you have fetched from GitHub.
All you do is remove the line(s) of text that you do not want to keep (or edit
the line(s) to be something else entirely), and remove the bracketing lines
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;...</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;...</code>, and the <code>======</code> line.</p>
<p>Save each conflicted file and then (as mentioned previously):</p>
<pre><code>git add &lt;filename(s)&gt;
git com &quot;Kept Kim&#39;s edits as more consistent with remaining text.&quot;
git p</code></pre>

<div id="exercise-3-collaborating-on-a-single-repository" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.4</span> Exercise 3: collaborating on a single repository</h3>
<p>If you have a colleague available, try what we just did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Person 1 creates a new repository on GitHub and clone to their computer.</li>
<li>Give the Person 2 ‘push access’ to the repository (on the repo page on GitHub: Settings – Manage access – Invite a collaborator)</li>
<li>Person 2 clones to their computer</li>
<li>Both create a simple text file (use different filenames), add some text and, as usual, <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>push</code>.</li>
<li><code>git fetch</code> and <code>git rebase</code> to get the other person’s file.</li>
<li>Continue editing either file, committing, and pushing.</li>
<li>If you get the push error (shown earlier), refresh GitHub repository site to
see recent commits (click on the X commits link, where X shows the total
number of commits to the repository). You can easily spot the
other person’s recent commits. Click on one (the bold message) to see
details.</li>
<li>Purposefully create a conflict (both edit the same line of the same
file). Resolve it as described earlier.</li>
<li>In practice you won’t commit so frequently when working, but this is good to get the hang of it.</li>

<div id="collaborating-summary" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.5</span> Collaborating summary</h3>
<p>Congratulations, you now know the few basic commands and functionality needed to collaborate with Git and GitHub.
It takes a bit of practice, but it is very powerful.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">95% of the time, this is all you are doing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Change some code.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git s
git d
git  com &quot;My commit message&quot;`
git p</code></pre>
<p>(the <code>git s</code> and <code>git d</code> are useful to check you have changed only what you think you have changed).</p>
<p>If GitHub does not allow you to push then on GitHub check your colleague’s latest commits
that you haven’t yet seen, and if they look fine then:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
git rebase</code></pre>
<p>(If you don’t agree with your colleague’s latest commits, then still rebase them
but then manually edit the files to be what you want. Though if you want to completely
cancel their commits see <code>git revert</code> in the Advanced section below).</p>
<p>If conflicts, then</p>
<pre><code>git rebase --abort
git merge</code></pre>
<p>fix the conflicts manually and then</p>
<pre><code>git add &lt;conflicted file(s)&gt;
git com &quot;Message to explain what you did&quot;
git p</code></pre>
<p>Change some code and repeat!</p>

<div id="workflow-tips-when-collaborating" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Workflow tips when collaborating</h2>
<p>Here are some tips that we’ve developed based on our own experiences.</p>
<p>Overall, remember that you still edit and save your files in the usual way on your
local computer. If you don’t do Git commits you will still have the <span style="color: red;">latest versions
of your files on your computer</span>, as you would if you weren’t using Git at all. So if
you do get stuck with Git you can carry on working as normal (though you
probably do want to try and fix it at some point).</p>
<p>When collaborating:</p>
<ul>
<li>If working closely with others, when you start each day (or after a break)
then make sure you are up to date and have all their commits. Refresh the
GitHub page for you repository, and <code>git fetch</code> (or just <code>git f</code>) and <code>git clone</code> if needed. (To
be safe you can <code>git f</code> and <code>git s</code> to check).</li>
<li>We find it helpful to co-ordinate our work (Slack is useful for this, or use
GitHub Issues for complex discussion – see below), so that if multiple people
are working at the same time, you are at least not working on exactly the same
parts, just to reduce conflicts.</li>
<li>Commit fairly frequently and write helpful commit messages (so your colleagues
get an idea of what you’ve done in each commit). Push less frequently, and
<em>don’t push code that doesn’t work</em> – that will annoy your colleagues. And
then they (and probably you) may both spend time fixing it.</li>
<li>To see who last edited a particular piece of code, when viewing the file on
GitHub click <span style="color: red;">Blame</span>, as mentioned earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GitHub Issues</strong></p>
<p>GitHub <em>Issues</em> are very useful for discussing issues with your repo. For our
annual Pacific Hake assessment we have used them extensively over the years:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/hakeIssues21.png" title="Example screenshot of GitHub Issues, click on Issues in any repository in GitHub to see more." alt="Example screenshot of GitHub Issues, click on Issues in any repository in GitHub to see more." width="910" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The Issues tab lists our current ‘Open’ issues – we have 20, of which five (the
most recently posted) are
shown here. We are currently in-between assessments (and not working on it), so
we have created Issues that we want to think about or deal with for next
year. This avoids forgetting about ideas or losing them in old emails.</p>
<p>Issues are intuitive to use. There is a bright green ‘New Issues’ button to
create new ones, you give a title and then write some details, people can reply,
you can assign people to look at them, and you can close them. In the above
screenshot you can see that we have closed 815 issues (this was over several years).</p>
<p>Useful tip: when doing a commit that refers to an Issue, if you refer to the
Issue number (with <code>#&lt;number&gt;</code>) in your commit message, then after pushing that commit the Issue on
GitHub will automatically mention and link to the commit:</p>
<p><code>git com &quot;Add more options to fancy_function(), #21.&quot;</code></p>
<p>will mention the commit when you look at the issue. You can even automatically
close the issue by saying <code>closes #21</code> in your commit message:</p>
<p><code>git com &quot;Add more options to fancy_function(), closes #21.&quot;</code></p>
<p>Issues are particularly useful to avoid cluttering up code with commented notes
or ideas that you may easily not come back to, or avoiding endless emails that
end up getting overlooked. You don’t have to fix an Issue to close it, you can
decide not to pursue, but at least you have made a decision.</p>
<p>(We also use Slack a lot to communicate, but moreso for quick questions or
bouncing ideas around – Issues are better for stuff that you want to come back
to at some point).</p>
<p>You may receive emails regarding Issues, but if you use GitHub a lot you will
see Notifications (the blue dot on the bell in the top-right corner when signed
in on GitHub) and that
will show you new Issues of repositories you are involved with, or if anyone has
updated an Issue.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub organizations</strong></p>
<p>If you will frequently collaborate with colleagues, you can create an
Organization on GitHub and invite collaborators to it (click on your GitHub
photo in the top-right corner, Settings, Organizations). Then they will
automatically have access to all repositories created under the
Organization. You can choose the security settings.</p>
<p>So, congratulations for getting this far – we have covered the basics of Git
and GitHub to get you going. Occasionally you might get messed up, but it is
generally hard to actually lose any work. If you get stuck then see ‘The power to go
back’ part of the next section, that contains more advanced material. Good luck
and happy committing!</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Beyond the basics of Git and GitHub – getting more advanced</h2>
<p>This section gives slightly more advanced background that should further improve
your understanding (including why Git is useful even when not collaborating or
sharing your code).
If you’re doing this module for the first time maybe read this section now so
that you know what is here, but don’t worry

<div id="so-ive-made-some-changes-but-dont-really-want-to-keep-them-git-stash" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.1</span> So I’ve made some changes but don’t really want to keep them – git stash</h3>
<p>If you’ve changed some code but <em>have not committed it</em>, and then maybe got in a
mess and just want to go back to your last commit, you can <em>stash</em> your changes</p>
<pre><code>git stash</code></pre>
<p>and to include a message (for your future self):</p>
<pre><code>git stash save &quot;Message&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This stashes them away such that they can be retrieved later if necessary.
This is handy. You may <em>think</em> you don’t want to keep those changes, but
sometimes you may later wish you had kept them somehwere.
Note this is only for files that Git is tracking (i.e. files that have been added
at some point).</p>
<p>To retrieve the last stash, you ‘pop’ them back into your working copy with:
<code>git stash pop</code></p>
<p>You can have multiple stashes, seen by doing:</p>
<pre><code>git stash list</code></pre>
<p>To deal with these, and other aspects of <code>stash</code>, see <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>If you are really really sure that you do not want to keep your recent changes,
see the ‘Undoing changes not yet committed’ section near the end of this module.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-power-to-go-back" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.2</span> The power to go back</h3>
<p>With Git you can revert back to any previous state of your repository.
This is <span style="color: red;">very powerful</span>, though slightly
<span style="color: red;">scary</span> at first.</p>
<p>Do this with your test repository, that should have some files in it from the
earlier excercise:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git s</code> to make sure you are all up-to-date
(<code>commit</code> and/or <code>push</code> if necessary).</li>
<li>In File Explorer (or whatever you use) look at your repository, you should see
all your files, including the <code>new-stuff\</code> directory.</li>
<li>Look at the commit tab on GitHub for your test repo and click on the clipboard
icon to copy the HASH number thingy to the clipboard .</li>
<li>In Git shell: <code>git checkout HASH</code> (where <code>HASH</code> is the pasted HASH, or <code>git co HASH</code> using our Alias)</li>
<li>Look at File Explorer again – your <code>new-stuff</code> directory should
have … disappeared!!</li>
<li>(If it hasn’t disappeared then open it – the test files, i.e. <code>test1.r</code>,
<code>test2.r</code>, etc. should be gone, but your text editor may
have saved backup versions; manually delete them plus the
<code>new-stuff/</code> directory.)</li>
<li>You are now back to the very first version of your repo!</li>
</ul>
<p>Powerful and scary.</p>
<p>Now, to get your files back to the most recent version you had committed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git checkout main</code> (it used to be <code>git checkout master</code>, the names have recently changed).</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! Check that your files are back. All this means that you can
<span style="color: red;">revert to any previous commit in your repository</span>.</p>
<p>This is very reassuring. For example you have some complex code that you realise
is now a complete mess and you want to go back to yesterday’s version of everything.</p>
<p>In practice you rarely actually do this, but it’s very comforting to know
that you can.</p>
<p>Consequently, your workflow is less cluttered and more tractable than having
to save multiple versions of the same files with dates in the filename, such
as this nightmare:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/EAversions.png" title="Example showing multiple saved versions of the same file, to show what you can avoid by using Git." alt="Example showing multiple saved versions of the same file, to show what you can avoid by using Git." width="314" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><strong>Retrieving older work in practice</strong></p>
<p>I think there are fancy ways that Git can replace a current file with a version
from an earlier commit. But, in practice (especially since you rarely want to do
this) it is a bit safer to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Say you are up-to-date (<code>git s</code> says all is good), but your program
<code>my_code.R</code> just isn’t working and you want to go back to the version you had
yesterday at commit number <code>abc123</code>.</li>
<li><code>git co abc123</code> (or <code>git checkout abc123</code>) to checkout the earlier commit,
which includes the old version of <code>my_code.R</code> that you want get.</li>
<li>Copy <code>my_code.R</code> to a new file <code>my_code_old.R</code>. In the shell you can just do
this with <code>cp my_code.R my_code_old.R</code>.</li>
<li>Do NOT edit <code>my_code.R</code> or make any changes, as you may end up with a scary
<code>DETACHED HEAD</code> warning.</li>
<li><code>git co main</code> to checkout the latest version again.</li>
<li>Since you have NOT done <code>git add my_code_old.R</code>, Git is not tracking
<code>my_code_old.R</code> and so it is just sitting in your folder as normal.</li>
<li>Now you can manually copy what you want from <code>my_code_old.R</code> into <code>my_code.R</code>
to fix your problem. It could be the full file, or just some part of it.</li>
<li>Then commit as normal.</li>
<li>At some point you can delete <code>my_code_old.R</code> so it is not hanging around, but
you don’t have to. (Though maybe make a note in it as to which commit it was
from, in case you do need it again).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="so-how-does-git-do-all-this" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.3</span> So how does Git do all this?</h3>
<p>By now you’re probably wondering how Git keeps track of everything.
Git does not keep versions of code, it keeps <em>commits</em>. The commits
are kept track of using a HASH key which is a generated 40-digit key in
hexadecimal (base 16). The hashes are
what you see on GitHub and in various places when you use Git shell.</p>
<p>By stitching all the commits back together again, Git can recreate all your code.</p>
<p>There is a hidden <code>.git/</code> directory in each repository.
Look at the <code>.git/objects/</code> subdirectory. Each subdirectory name is the
first two digits of a HASH. The rest of the digits of the HASH are the filenames in the
subdirectory.</p>
<p>You can basically think of the hashes as representing <code>commits</code> (apparently they can also
be <code>blobs</code> and <code>trees</code>, whatever they might be).
I think of the files in the subdirectories containing the <span style="color: red;">differences</span> between each commit.</p>
<p>Because of these structures, Git can go back and <span style="color: red;">rebuild</span> any or
all files at any <code>commit</code>, and even have different directory
structures at each commit.</p>
<p>Since Git is keeping track of differences between files, this all works best for
plain ASCii (text) files, such as <code>.R</code>, <code>.txt</code>, <code>.Rmd</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Git does work for binary files, such as <code>.xls</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.RData</code>, but since
changes to the files are not easily saved (Git essentially has to resave
the whole file at each commit), this is not very efficient and may make
your repository large. Such files will be fully resaved every time they
are changed. Think of a binary file as something that you cannot open in a
text editor and read (it does not contain simple ASCii letters and numbers).</p>
<p>Exceptions: often you may have an image or photo or other type file that you need to share for a
document, but it isn’t going to keep changing. So that’s fine to commit.</p>
<p>An example of why you should not commit binary files:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collaborator was running some R code (and correctly committed the <code>.R</code> files
so that I could run it), but also committed the results, which included
<code>.pdf</code>, <code>.png</code> and <code>.RData</code> files, which can get quite large.</li>
<li>But, these latter files got updated every time the code was run. So changing
one line of the <code>.R</code> code (which Git deals with very efficiently), and running
that code and committing, resulted in the new <code>.pdf</code> etc. files being fully
saved (since Git cannot just save the difference from the last commit because
they are binary files). Even
if, say, one point changes on a figure in a graph in a <code>.pdf</code> file, Git has to
save the whole new version.</li>
<li>This ended up with <code>.git/objects/pack</code> (whatever that might be!) being 2.8Gb.</li>
<li>I needed space quickly on my computer so just deleted four files in
<code>.git/objects/pack</code>, which freed up 1.6Gb.</li>
<li>Note that I still had the actual final versions of files (as you would
if not using Git), but just not the full repository history.</li>
<li>However, when I tried to later do some work and then <code>commit</code> I got lots of
‘fatal’ errors with scary messages like <code>bad object HEAD</code> and the awesomely titled <code>You are on a branch yet to be born</code>:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/notGood.png" title="Example of why you shouldn't mess with the .git directory, as you get confusing error messages and have to start again." alt="Example of why you shouldn't mess with the .git directory, as you get confusing error messages and have to start again." width="501" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>I just had to start again from scratch (<code>clone</code> again I think). Take-home message:</p>
<p><strong>Don’t mess with the .git directory!!</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="git-terminology" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.4</span> Git terminology</h3>
<p>At some point you will likely need to search online for some help (often
questions are posted and answered on the excellent ‘stackoverflow’ website).
A bit more understanding of terminology will help you.</p>
<p>Remember that Git keeps <em>commits</em>.
Several of these commits have pointers to them that have special names:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HEAD</strong> points to the commit you are currently on in the Git shell.</li>
<li><strong>main</strong> or <strong>master</strong> is the default branch when you set up a repository on
GitHub (it is usually <strong>main</strong> now because of recent changes on GitHub).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="branching" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.5</span> Branching</h3>
<p>So far we have only worked on the <strong>main</strong> branch. Sometimes you want to create
a new branch that branches off from the <strong>main</strong> branch. It’s bit like a tree
branching, except that at some point you want your new branch to be merged back
into <strong>main</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to try adding some new code to your project, but don’t
want to break what is already there. You may do this even if working alone, but
it’s especially useful if you are collaborating, or if, say, you have an R
packages hosted on GitHub that anyone may be downloading – you don’t want to
annoy them by pushing experimental code that doesn’t work.</p>
<p>So you would create a new branch, work on that new branch (i.e. commit
changes to the new branch), and when you are happy with your new changes you can
easily merge it all back into <strong>main</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Working on a new branch</strong></p>
<p>When creating a new branch, your starting point is identical to the branch you
were when you created the new one.</p>
<p>In the Git shell navigate into your test repository:</p>
<p><code>cd test</code></p>
<p>Depending on your set up, you should see <code>main</code> indicated somewhere (if not do
<code>git s</code> and it should say <code>On branch main</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure you are up-to-date and have committed all changes (<code>git s</code>, and
<code>commit</code> if necessary).</p>
<p>Create a new branch called <em>temp</em>, this will be based off the latest commit of the <em>main</em>
branch you are currently on:</p>
<p><code>git checkout -b temp</code></p>
<p>(We have an alias for that: <code></code>git cb temp`).</p>
<p>You will be automatically placed in the new branch called <em>temp</em>, and commits
you make will now occur in that branch only.</p>
<p>Make and <code>commit</code> some changes (e.g. add a new file) – these will now be on
your <em>temp</em> branch.</p>
<p>You can push to GitHub. The first time you try <code>git p</code>, the Git shell will
tell you that you need to type the following so that future pushes go to the
new branch:</p>
<p><code>git --set-upstream origin BRANCH-NAME</code></p>
<p>Check the GitHub webpage to see that your branch was pushed. You repository
page (that will still be looking at your <em>main</em> branch) may tell you that
there is a <em>temp</em> branch with more recent commits than <em>main</em>. If not then if
you click on the <em>main</em> drop-down menu:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/main-branch.png" title="Example of clicking on main drop-down menu on GitHub to view other branches." alt="Example of clicking on main drop-down menu on GitHub to view other branches." width="236" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>it should give you the option to look at your new <em>temp</em> branch. (The ‘1 branch’
in the above image should also say ‘2 branches’).</p>
<p>You can now view your new file in your new <em>temp</em> branch on GitHub.</p>
<p>A graphical way to see and understand branching is to click on
Insights–Network to see the Network graph.</p>
<p>The Network Graph is a useful visualization tool, where each commit is shown as
a point on the graph (the numbers along the top are the dates). You can hover
your mouse over a commit to see who committed it and the commit message. You can
click to see full details of the commit. The Network Graph is particularly
useful if you or others are working on multiple branches, or to check details
about merges.</p>
<p>Okay, back in your Git shell you can easily switch back to your original <em>main</em>
branch:</p>
<p><code>git checkout main</code> (or the alias <code>git co main</code>).</p>
<p>You will see that the file you just added is gone, because it
<span style="color: red;">only exists in the <em>temp</em> branch</span>
at this moment.</p>
<p>Imagine that in your <em>temp</em> branch you did several commits to create a new
function in your code, or have added some new text to a report. Now you are
happy with what you’ve done you want to merge it back into the <em>main</em> branch.</p>
<p>To view all local branches:</p>
<p><code>git branch</code></p>
<p>There is an asterisk next to the branch you are currently in.</p>
<p>To switch to another branch (<em>main</em> in our case):</p>
<p><code>git checkout main</code></p>
<p>To combine the changes from the <em>temp</em> branch:</p>
<p><code>git rebase temp</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>git merge temp</code></p>
<p>Now the file you created in the <em>temp</em> branch now appears in the <em>main</em>
branch. All commits done in the <em>temp</em> branch will now be in the <em>main</em> branch
as well.</p>
<p>If there was a merge conflict, you must fix it at this point (see earleir).</p>
<p>Once you’ve merged your <em>temp</em> branch into <em>main</em>, you don’t really need <em>temp</em>
any more and so it is good protocol to delete to keep things tidy:</p>
<p><code>git branch -d temp</code></p>
<p>If you have unmerged changes in a branch, you will not be allowed to delete it,
but Git shell will tell you the command to forcibly delete it:</p>
<p><code>git branch -D temp</code></p>
<p>Warning – you won’t be able to get any of those changes back once you do this.</p>
<p>To remove a branch entirely from GitHub:</p>
<p><code>git p origin --delete BRANCH-NAME</code></p>

<div id="pull-requests" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.6</span> Pull requests</h3>
<p>You often hear about ‘Pull requests’, but in my workflow I’ve rarely used
them. A pull request is when a
contributor asks a maintainer of a Git repository to review code the contributor
wants merged into the repository. It’s not really used when collaborating with your
own team, but more when you have started with someone else’s repository and
either made a branch or forked it, made some improvements (you hope!), and then
you request that they pull your improvements into their main repository. So
fairly advanced. For more details see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="undoing-stuff" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.7</span> Undoing stuff</h3>
<p>If you make a commit followed by other commits, then realize you want to undo the earlier commit, you use <em>revert</em>:</p>
<p><code>git revert HASH</code></p>
<p>where <code>HASH</code> is the hash for the commit you want to undo. Remember that Git shell is smart enough that you only need the first five digits:</p>
<p><code>git revert 1ef1d</code></p>
<p>This actually creates a new commit with the automatic message</p>
<p><code>Revert &quot;&lt;previous commit message&gt;&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Obviously, you have to be careful with this if you’re changing something that
was a few commits back, as you might mess up your code.</p>
<p><strong>Undoing changes not yet committed</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve made a mess in your working directory and you want to change
everything back to the way it was on the last commit:</p>
<p><code>git reset --hard HEAD</code></p>
<p>If you’ve messed up a single file and just want that one file to go back to the way it was on the last commit:</p>
<p><code>git checkout HEAD &lt;filename_to_restore&gt;</code></p>
<p>Warning – running these commands will delete the changes you have made. Since
you have not committed any changes, they will be lost. Make sure you are certain
you don’t need the changes before running these commands. If you aren’t sure if
you need the changes again in the future, use <code>git stash</code> instead.</p>
<p><strong>Changing the commit message in the last commit</strong></p>
<p>If you make a commit then realize you want to change it (add more information,
fix something that will confuse your colleagues, fix something that will confuse
you tomorrow), you can change the commit message:</p>
<p><code>git commit --amend -m &quot;Correct message.&quot;</code></p>
<p>This only works on the last commit.</p>
<p>If you already pushed the commit before realizing that the message needs modification, do this:</p>
<p><code>git p --force</code></p>
<p>after making the amendment to the commit message.</p>

<div id="using-r-and-github-within-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.8</span> Using R and GitHub within RStudio</h3>
<p>If you use RStudio to work in R, then you
may want to use RStudio to use Git. Having already learnt the basic Git commands in a
shell should help you.</p>
<p>One way of using Git in RStudio is just to use the commands we have learnt
within the ‘Terminal’:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/Rstudio-terminal.png" title="Example screenshot of using Git in the RStudio terminal." alt="Example screenshot of using Git in the RStudio terminal." width="1163" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, the RStudio interface has buttons with words that you are now familiar with, such as
‘Diff’ and ‘Commit’:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/Rstudio-git.png" title="Screenshot of the Git buttons in RStudio." alt="Screenshot of the Git buttons in RStudio." width="622" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The blue arrow has options for fetching from GitHub, while the green arrow
is for pushing to GitHub.</p>
<p>When you commit, instead of including the message in the Git
command like we did, with <code>git com &quot;&lt;Message&gt;&quot;</code>, RStudio opens a window:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/Rstudio-commit-message.png" title="Screenshot of the Git commit message window in RStudio." alt="Screenshot of the Git commit message window in RStudio." width="603" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>As you can see, having learnt what these various Git commands mean, it may be fairly
intuitive how to proceed.</p>
<p>To delve further, Jenny Bryan’s <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/index.html" target="_blank">Happy Git and GitHub for the
useR</a> course introduces using Git in
RStudio. It was originally developed for advanced-level statistics courses and
is aimed at intermediate to advanced R users. It does include some use of a
shell (like our module); for details on pre-requisites see
<a href="https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#audience-and-pre-reqs" target="_blank">here</a>.
Having worked through our Git and GitHub module, you should
easily be able to pick up the necessary components that you need.</p>
<p>In this module’s videos that had R code, I was using the Emacs text editor. I’ve
used it for years for many reasons: it automatically
highlights code in any language, is extremely versatile, has keyboard shortcuts
which you can learn once and use forever, and as such it is
fast to use when programming and
avoids lots of mouse use (which can help avoid repetitive strain
injury). I run R in Emacs with Emacs Speaks Statistics, and often use magit which is a
way of using Git in Emacs. Also, enhancements to Emacs can improve
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryAccessibility" target="_blank">accessibility</a> for those
that need it; for example, Emacs’ customisability can <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/talks/08/" target="_blank">greatly improve productivity
for visually impaired programmers</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, one colleague use RStudio to run R, Emacs to edit R files, and
magit (in Emacs) to run Git. You will likely similarly figure out what setup works best
for you.</p>
